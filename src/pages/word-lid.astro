          Freedom and equality sound self-evident. In practice, they aren’t.
          They require people who step up, commit, and keep pushing where it
          still grinds. That is exactly what we do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stichting Vrijheid &amp; Gelijkheid works for human rights, equal
          opportunity, and the protection of human values and standards—not as
          an abstract ideal, but as something that makes a measurable difference
          in daily life. We choose impact over symbolism, action over
          statements.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          As a member you’re not a bystander—you’re part of a network that
          drives change. You contribute to concrete initiatives, strategic
          campaigns, and durable solutions. No endless talk—focused effort where
          it truly matters.

          <p class="micro-text">
            Human rights in the Netherlands and Europe aren’t undermined by one
            single crisis, but by a thousand small normalizations. Exclusion,
            unequal treatment, and legal grey areas become routine. STVG exists
            to break that normalization—with sources, cooperation, and focused
            action.

        <h2>Membership means:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>pushing back together where inequality has become “normal”</li>
          <li>
            combining knowledge, influence, and resources for real outcomes
          </li>
          <li>standing for values, even when it’s uncomfortable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is not a club for applause at a distance. It’s a community of
          people who understand that freedom and equality need maintenance.

        <h2>Our approach</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
          STVG works independently, based on sources, and transparently. We do
          not run party-political campaigns, we don’t collect personal data
          without necessity, and we publish our sources. Impact is measured by
          change, not visibility.
